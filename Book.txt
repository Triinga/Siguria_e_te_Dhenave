Authentication is a term which is used    and often abused  in a very broad sense  By itself
it has little meaning other than to convey the idea that some means has been provided to
guarantee that entities are who they claim to be   or that information has not been manipulated by
 unauthorized parties  Authentication is specific to the security objective which
one is trying to achieve  Examples of specific objectives include access control   entity authentication
message authentication   data integrity   non   repudiation   and key authentication  These instances of authentication are dealt with at length in Chapters 9 through 13
For the purposes of this chapter   it suffices to give a brief introduction to authentication by
describing several of the most obvious applications
Authentication is one of the most important of all information security objectives  Until the mid
s it was generally believed that secrecy and authentication were intrinsically
connected  With the discovery of hash functions and digital signatures it was
realized that secrecy and authentication were truly separate and independent information
security objectives  It may at first not seem important to separate the two but there are
 situations where it is not only useful but essential  For example   if a two   party communication
between Alice and Bob is to take place where Alice is in one country and Bob in another
the host countries might not permit secrecy on the channel     one or both countries might
want the ability to monitor all communications  Alice and Bob   however   would like to be
assured of the identity of each other   and of the integrity and origin of the information they
send and receive
The preceding scenario illustrates several independent aspects of authentication  If Alice
 and Bob desire assurance of each other  s identity   there are two possibilities to consider
Alice and Bob could be communicating with no appreciable time delay  That is   they
are both active in the communication in    real time
 Alice or Bob could be exchanging messages with some delay  That is   messages
might be routed through various networks   stored   and forwarded at some later time
In the first instance Alice and Bob would want to verify identities in real time  This
might be accomplished by Alice sending Bob some challenge   to which Bob is the only
entity which can respond correctly  Bob could perform a similar action to identify Alice
This type of authentication is commonly referred to as entity authentication or more simply
identification
For the second possibility   it is not convenient to challenge and await response   and
moreover the communication path may be only in one direction  Different techniques are
now required to authenticate the originator of the message  This form of authentication is
called data origin authentication
Cryptography has a long and fascinating history  The most complete non   technical account
of the subject is Kahn  s The Codebreakers  This book traces cryptography from its initial
and limited use by the Egyptians some 4000 years ago   to the twentieth century where it
played a crucial role in the outcome of both world wars  Completed in 1963   Kahn  s book
covers those aspects of the history which were most significant    up to that time  to the development of the subject
The predominant practitioners of the art were those associated with
the military   the diplomatic service and government in general  Cryptography was used as
a tool to protect national secrets and strategies
The proliferation of computers and communications systems in the 1960s brought with
it a demand from the private sector for means to protect information in digital form and to
provide security services  Beginning with the work of Feistel at IBM in the early 1970s and
culminating in 1977 with the adoption as a U S  Federal Information Processing Standard
for encrypting unclassified information   DES   the Data Encryption Standard   is the most
well   known cryptographic mechanism in history  It remains the standard means for securing electronic commerce for many financial institutions around the world
The most striking development in the history of cryptography came in 1976 when Diffie
and Hellman published New Directions in Cryptography This paper introduced the revolutionary concept of public   key cryptography and also provided a new and ingenious method
